üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis App

A smart, AI-powered application that automatically classifies restaurant reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative, helping restaurant managers understand customer feedback at a glance and make data-driven decisions.


Overview

Sentiment analysis is a crucial tool for understanding human feedback at scale. This project uses a restaurant review dataset to train a model capable of classifying reviews into Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiment.

Although the dataset is from restaurants, the model and workflow are industry-agnostic and can be applied to any scenario where textual feedback exists.


Key Features

Batch Analysis: Supports analyzing multiple reviews at once.

User-Friendly GUI: Built using Tkinter for interactive input and instant feedback.

Versatile Dataset Handling: Can be retrained on other domains (e.g., product reviews, tweets, survey responses).

Real-Life Applications

This project illustrates how sentiment analysis can provide real-world value in multiple areas:

Customer Feedback: Automatically analyze product or service reviews to identify strengths and weaknesses.

Social Media Monitoring: Detect public sentiment trends for brands or campaigns.

Market Research: Understand customer preferences and emerging trends.

Financial Analysis: Analyze news or forum posts to gauge market sentiment.

Decision Support: Convert large volumes of unstructured text into actionable insights.
